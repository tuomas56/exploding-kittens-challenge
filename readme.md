#### Do you speak python 3?
If not, `exit(We hope to see you next year)`.

#### Do you know how to play the card game exploding kittens?
If not, [go there](https://explodingkittens.com/how-to-play).

#### Do you want to build an AI player and try to beat everyone else?
If not, `exit(We hope to see you next year)`.

#### Are you still here?
If yes, and assuming you have a working version of python3 in your computer, please type in a terminal:

```
pip install pyCardDeck numpy

git clone git@github.com:zfountas/exploding-kittens-challenge.git

cd exploding-kittens-challenge

cp player.py <your_name>.py
```

Now there are three python files in this folder. Your goal is to work on the file with your name, and in particular to change the class Player and develop a bot that is able to play this game. To test your bot, please type

```
python play_game.py player player <your_name>
```

The more cards your bot takes into account the more chances it has to win.

Of course, intelligence is not only determined by knowledge ;)

When you feel you're ready, please email the file with your name to [f@emotech.co](f@emotech.co).
